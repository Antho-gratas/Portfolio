## It's all because of him My dad.) <br /><br />

During my childhood, I noticed that my father spent a lot of time working on the computer. He would occasionally take breaks to play games, such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Crysis. I also enjoyed playing games and would often go to computer clubs with my friends. However, as time passed, our interests began to change. <br /><br />

Finally, my father gave me my first computer, an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and a GeForce 7800 GTX video card. It was cool to get acquainted with the computer and learn what I could do on it. Dealing with Windows XP was a separate pleasure üòÇ. <br /><br />

As I grew up, I entered the faculty of 'Computer Systems and Sets' where I learned about how a computer is built, machine code, Assembler, Pascal, Delphi, Photoshop, WEB, and websites.
I wrote my first programs using Pascal and Delphi. I posted the source code of my Delphi programs on my [blog](https://freeexpa.wordpress.com/), which still works on WordPress.<br /><br />

Later, I taught myself how to develop websites using a regular Windows Notepad as my first IDE. Eventually, I learned about Notepad++, Sublime, and even VS Code. 
I became interested in Linux and its distributions, including Ubuntu, and eventually fell in love with Arch Linux. <br /><br />

During college, I learned about CSS style sheets, HTML markup language, and web standards. At the time, layout floats were still popular, which made it a nightmare!  I studied JavaScript, but found it difficult due to its syntax. I took a break from it and started learning Python. Python has a clear and concise syntax with a wide range of libraries. I wrote small programs with UI libraries for personal use.<br /><br />

I was drawn to the web because I wanted to show the world what I can do and be useful. I studied WordPress and its plugins, as well as ACF, kernel optimization, server setup for WordPress, Apache deployment, and enabling gzip compression on a local server. I find these topics interesting and set goals to learn how they work and achieve results.<br /><br />

While growing up, I searched for a job and landed an internship at a company that specialized in WordPress website development. During my time there, I was responsible for managing website pages and communicating with backend developers. I found the experience to be very interesting and enjoyable, especially since I was being paid for it.
<br /><br />
The company I worked for next developed business websites. They had over 100 sites written in HTML/CSS integrated into WordPress, but they were poorly optimized. My task was to optimize and integrate them correctly to ensure they functioned smoothly. After that, I worked as a freelancer. <br /><br />

I worked for myself after which I became a freelancer. For me, freelancing is like paradise because I have the freedom to choose my clients, set my own deadlines, and work on tasks from scratch. I don't have to deal with someone else's code base, which makes my work easier. It's hard to list all the benefits of freelancing, but it's safe to say that I enjoy it a lot. üòÇ<br /><br />

On Freelance, I developed several websites, which you can find in the portfolio section of my website. One of them was an online store for the brand Byshikat, a private sewing factory for women's shoes. Nowadays I successfully completed the task, and the client is satisfied, especially considering that the store brought in over 1000% increase in sales compared to their Instagram store in the first month after launch.<br /><br />

## Our days<br /><br />

I am currently studying Astro Framework. This website is built using JavaScript and React. After a long journey of self-discovery, I have finally decided on this technology stack. <br /><br />

Thank you for reading. Thank you for reading. Your support motivates me to continue learning and improving. Have a great day! I'll be in touch. üòâ<br /><br />
